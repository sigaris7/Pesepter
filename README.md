# Pesepter
Pesepter is a program used to generate passwords to various websites. The program works locally on the computer. It does not connect to any server, so the generated passwords are known only to the user who will run the program locally on his computer.

The program requires no installation. Just run the .exe file.

I allow using the program for commercial and private purposes for free.
